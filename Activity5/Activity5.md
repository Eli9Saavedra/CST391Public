# Summary of Part 1
In Part 1 of the assignment, we began by creating a new React app named "music" and cleared its default contents. Then, we defined a basic functional component named App to render JSX content, incorporating album data using Bootstrap's card markup. We explored custom components by creating a separate Card.js file to encapsulate the card component, enhancing code organization and reusability.

# Summary of Part 2
In Mini App #1 - State Changer Demo, we created a new React app named "statechanger" to showcase the usage of state, props, and methods for updating application state. After clearing the default contents, we built functional components like App.js and Counter.js, employing hooks like useState to manage state. These components demonstrate how props from parent components and state changes triggered by user actions drive UI updates in React, essential concepts for understanding React's core functionality.


## Part 3: Using State and Props in the Music Application

# Summary of Part 3
In Part 2, we revisited the music application, implementing newfound knowledge about props, state, and event handlers. By updating App.js, we introduced a state property called albumList to manage dynamic data. Props, passed from parent components, were utilized to influence the appearance of child components. The renderedList() function mapped through each album in albumList, generating JSX elements for each card component, demonstrating the use of the map function. Additionally, we applied CSS styling using Bootstrap's grid system and Flexbox to arrange the cards horizontally for improved layout.
