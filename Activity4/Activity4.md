# Research
### Research how an Angular application maintains a logged in state. How does it communicate this state to the server?

**In Angular applications, maintaining a logged-in state involves verifying user credentials against a server-side authentication system upon login. Successful authentication results in the storage of authentication tokens or session data, usually managed by Angular services and stored securely using mechanisms like HttpClient, localStorage, or third-party libraries. This stored state regulates access to restricted areas or functionalities within the application. Authentication tokens are then included in HTTP requests' headers to communicate the user's logged-in status to the server. This allows the server to validate the user's identity and authorize their actions based on their logged-in state, enabling secure interaction between the Angular application and the server-side backend.**
