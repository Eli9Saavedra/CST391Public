# Summary of Part 1
In this exercise, we created a dynamic React application that allows users to add and remove blog posts. We utilized functional components with hooks to manage the state, specifically using useState for tracking posts and their IDs. Through this process, we demonstrated the practical implementation of dynamic component rendering, state management, and event handling in React.
