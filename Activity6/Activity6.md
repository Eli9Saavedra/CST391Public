# Activity 6: React Music App API Data

## Part 1: External Source Data
**Screenshot 1: Our main page now has the albums from our database. You can see that there is a search bar on top as well so that the user can find a specific term in the albums. The image shows about the card, with the description below it.**

**Screenshot 2: Here we have the card based off what was searched in the search bar. The term Help was used and the album was filtered to be the only one showed.**

**Screenshot 3: Here we are in our dev tools so that we can see that the album has been filtered properdly, with the array returing in the console, as well as the term that was searched.**

# Summary of Part 1
In this part of the activity, we transition from managing album data within the application to utilizing an external JSON file. The album list, initially housed in the state initialization of App.js, is relocated to albums.json. This move sets the stage for integrating an Express Music API in the next phase of development. By importing the JSON file into App.js and utilizing useState and useEffect hooks, we establish a streamlined process for updating and rendering album data, setting the groundwork for further functionality expansion within the React Hook Lifecycle.
